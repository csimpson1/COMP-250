To save you time in grading, you should note that this code only
seems to solve the very simplest of sudoku puzzles. When run on harder problems
it does not fill in any empty spaces, and may modify one or two "constant"
members of the grid.I believe the problem has something to do with how the 
array of possible values for each cell is updated when the method 
recursiveSolve is called, but I cannot confirm this. I tried to watch the 
solving process using the DrJava debugger, but the editor 
eventually slowed to a halt and crashed.

Also, due to the structure of the code the possibilities array mentioned above
needed to be available at every level of the recursion, so I added it as a class
field and updated the constructor as to initialize it. Hopefully this doesn't
mess up any automated testing you might do.
